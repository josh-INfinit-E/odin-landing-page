# odin-landing-page

This is my first full webpage. 

I am excited to test my skills and see how well I have been able to learn flex. 

Ill touch base after I've finished the project and say how it went here. 



This is my follow up on the project.

This was a little harder than I expected in places. The padding and borders were a little confusing at moments but I think the finished product is very impressive for where I am at in this journey. 

If I had wanted to add anything else I would import a font but didn't feel like doing that. 

I am most impressed with how well I managed to allow the webpage to be resized and the content still flow very well.
